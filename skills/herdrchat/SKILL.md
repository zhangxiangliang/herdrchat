description: Set up, run and look after herdrchat, which mirrors every herdr-app (hc) tab into Feishu (a group per tab) or Telegram (a topic per tab): first setup of either app, start, stop, status, logs, running it as a service, settings, fixing problems, the Feishu developer console and @BotFather. Use for anything about herdrchat or its Feishu or Telegram bot, even "set up the Telegram bot", "is it running", "it does not post" or "mute the workers". Trigger with "/herdrchat", "/herdrchat setup", "/herdrchat status", "/herdrchat fix".

# herdrchat

herdrchat mirrors every herdr-app tab into a chat app: a group per tab in Feishu, a topic
per tab in the bot's private chat in Telegram; the conversation as it happens, dialogs as
buttons, an overview in the direct chat. One profile is one chat app (`HERDRCHAT_CHAT`):
one app uses the default profile; a second app beside it gets its own (`--profile <name>`).

Its command is `herdrchat` (`node bin/cli.mjs` in a clone): check with `command -v
herdrchat`; when it is missing, ask before `npm install -g herdrchat`. A profile
(`--profile`, default `default`) keeps its settings in
`~/.config/herdrchat/<profile>/config.env` and its state in
`~/.local/state/herdrchat/<profile>/`; `herdrchat status` prints both. Files named here
from the package (`config.env.example`, `docs/guide.md`) are in the installed package,
`$(npm root -g)/herdrchat/`, or in the clone.

## Commands

| Command | Do |
|---|---|
| `/herdrchat setup` | First ask which chat app (Feishu, Telegram, or both: the second one on its own profile). Telegram: `/herdrchat telegram setup`. Feishu, in this order: create the app, the bot ability and the scopes (`references/feishu.md`); `herdrchat init` and fill `config.env` with the user (App ID, App Secret, `HERDR_SESSIONS`: `ls ~/.local/state/herdr-core` lists the sessions); `herdrchat start` (the console's long-connection check needs it running); events and callbacks; publish a version; the user messages the bot and adds the `FEISHU_OWNER_OPEN_ID` line it answers with; `herdrchat start` again; offer `/herdrchat auth` and `herdrchat install`. |
| `/herdrchat status` | `herdrchat status`; explain each line; on errors, `/herdrchat fix`. |
| `/herdrchat start`, `/herdrchat stop` | Read `config.env` (its `HERDR_SESSIONS`) in one step, then `herdrchat start` / `stop` in the next; never both at once. With a service installed they go through it. |
| `/herdrchat install`, `/herdrchat uninstall` | Run it as a service of the system (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux): it starts at login and comes back after a crash, whatever happens to the hc cores. Recommended once it works. Read the config first; after a node upgrade, install again (`herdrchat status` says so). |
| `/herdrchat logs` | `herdrchat logs --errors` (or `-n 100`); explain them with `references/ops.md` "Logs". |
| `/herdrchat auth` | The user sends `/auth` to the bot and allows it on Feishu's page; the app needs the user scopes in `references/feishu.md`. Then groups are muted, labels and pins follow. |
| `/herdrchat config` | Change a setting in `config.env` with the user (sessions, `HERDR_MUTED_SPACES`, `HERDR_SILENT_SPACES`, `HERDR_BOT_TAGS`, `HERDR_USER_TAGS`, `HERDR_HISTORY`, `HERDRCHAT_CHAT`; each is explained in `config.env.example`), read the file back, then restart. |
| `/herdrchat fix` | Find the cause from `herdrchat status`, the logs and the live result, then fix it: `references/ops.md`. |
| `/herdrchat feishu <task>` | Anything in the Feishu developer console: scopes, callbacks, publishing, the icon, deleting an app: `references/feishu.md`. |
| `/herdrchat telegram <task>` | The Telegram bot (the default profile when it is the only app): `setup` (@BotFather, topic mode, token, owner id, first start), checking the token, quiet and silent spaces, what Telegram cannot do and what stands in: `references/telegram.md`. |

With no subcommand, run `herdrchat status` and suggest the next step from it.

## Rules

- Ask before anything outward-facing: publishing a version, applying scopes, deleting or
  disbanding anything, sending to a real group. One yes covers one action.
- Never print, screenshot or paste `FEISHU_APP_SECRET`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or
  `user-token.json`; ask the user to paste a token into `config.env` themselves.
- A check that decides an action runs on its own first (read the config, then start).
- Say what was checked on the live bot and what was not.

## References

- `references/feishu.md`: the bot's app in the Feishu developer console, with Ego or as a
  guided walk-through; the scopes this bot uses.
- `references/telegram.md`: the Telegram bot, from @BotFather to the first topic; what
  it does differently from Feishu.
- `references/ops.md`: running and checking the bot, its logs and state, the usual
  problems, trying a Feishu API safely, committing without a leak.
